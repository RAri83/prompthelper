Hello guys!
To use this Sadset source code to convert it into a plugin, open your IDE and open this project in it and compile it once. To rename the plugin to your own name and change all the codes, just change the main sections and rename them to your own name, and then change the code so that it matches your name, compile it, and get the output.
This plugin is written using Kotlin language.
